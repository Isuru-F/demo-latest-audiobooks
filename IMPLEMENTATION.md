# Multi-Cast Narrator Support Implementation

## Feature Requirements

As per Linear issue GTM-2, the following requirements were addressed:

1. A "Multi-Cast Only" toggle is displayed next to the search bar
2. When enabled, only audiobooks with more than one narrator are shown
3. Toggle state persists during search operations
4. Toggle can be combined with text search
5. Toggle shows visual indication of active state

## Implementation Details

The feature is already implemented in the codebase:

- Located in `client/src/views/AudiobooksView.vue`
- The toggle UI is implemented on lines 70-79
- The filter logic is implemented on lines 13-18
- Styling for the toggle is on lines 191-254

## Testing

The feature has comprehensive test coverage in `client/tests/multicast-filter.vitest.spec.ts` that tests:

1. Filtering audiobooks with multiple narrators when the toggle is activated
2. Persisting the filter state while performing search operations
3. Proper display of filtered results

All tests are passing, confirming the feature works as intended.
