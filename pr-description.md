# Fix HIGH Severity XSS Vulnerability in Users Controller

## Security Issue Fixed
Fixed HIGH severity Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in `server/src/controllers/users.controller.js` at line 44. The vulnerability allowed unsanitized user input to be directly rendered as HTML, enabling potential script injection attacks.

## Why This Mattered
The original code directly interpolated user input (name, bio, email) into HTML without any sanitization:
```javascript
// VULNERABLE CODE:
const profileHtml = `<p><strong>Name:</strong> ${name}</p>`;
```
This allowed attackers to inject malicious scripts like `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` that would execute in users' browsers.

## How The Fix Solves The Problem
1. **HTML Escaping**: Added `escape-html` library to properly escape all user inputs
2. **Input Validation**: Added length limits and email format validation
3. **Security Headers**: Implemented defense-in-depth with CSP and other security headers
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Created 12 test cases covering various XSS attack vectors

## Code Changes
- ✅ **Fixed**: Added proper HTML escaping for all user inputs
- ✅ **Enhanced**: Input validation with length limits and email format checking  
- ✅ **Secured**: Added Content-Security-Policy and other security headers
- ✅ **Tested**: 12 new security tests covering XSS, validation, and headers

## Project Status
- ✅ **Build Status**: Project still compiles successfully
- ✅ **Test Status**: All tests passing (21 total: 9 existing + 12 new)
- ✅ **Security Scan**: HIGH severity XSS vulnerability eliminated

## Tests Added
Added 12 comprehensive security tests:
- XSS prevention for script tags, img onerror, javascript: URLs, mouseover events
- Input validation for required fields, email format, length limits
- Security headers verification
- Normal functionality validation

## Technical Implementation
```javascript
// SECURE CODE:
const escape = require('escape-html');
const profileHtml = `<p><strong>Name:</strong> ${escape(name)}</p>`;
res.setHeader('Content-Security-Policy', "default-src 'self'");
```

## Human Testing Instructions
1. Visit `/api/users/profile` endpoint
2. POST with normal data: `{"name":"John", "bio":"Developer", "email":"john@example.com"}`
3. Expected: Profile page renders correctly
4. POST with XSS payload: `{"name":"<script>alert('XSS')</script>", "bio":"Normal", "email":"test@example.com"}`
5. Expected: Script tags appear as escaped text, no JavaScript execution
