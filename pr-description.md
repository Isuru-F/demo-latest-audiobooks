# Fix MEDIUM Severity Information Exposure via X-Powered-By Header

## Security Issue Fixed
Fixed MEDIUM severity Information Exposure vulnerability in `server/index.js` at line 5. The vulnerability exposed framework information through the Express.js X-Powered-By header, providing potential attackers with details about the technology stack.

## Why This Mattered
Express.js by default sets the `X-Powered-By: Express` header on all responses. This information disclosure helps attackers:
- Identify the web framework being used
- Target framework-specific vulnerabilities
- Craft more effective attack vectors
- Gather intelligence for reconnaissance

## How The Fix Solves The Problem
1. **Helmet Middleware**: Implemented comprehensive security middleware that automatically removes X-Powered-By header
2. **Defense-in-Depth**: Added 9+ additional security headers for comprehensive protection
3. **Zero Breaking Changes**: Helmet transparently enhances security without affecting functionality
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Created 15 test cases covering all security headers

## Code Changes
- ✅ **Added**: Helmet middleware for comprehensive security headers
- ✅ **Fixed**: X-Powered-By header completely eliminated
- ✅ **Enhanced**: 9+ additional security headers added for defense-in-depth
- ✅ **Tested**: 15 new comprehensive security header tests

## Security Headers Added
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: `nosniff` - Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **X-Frame-Options**: `SAMEORIGIN` - Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-Download-Options**: `noopen` - Prevents IE from executing downloads
- **Referrer-Policy**: `no-referrer` - Controls referrer information sharing
- **X-DNS-Prefetch-Control**: `off` - Disables DNS prefetching
- **Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy**: Enhanced cross-origin security
- **Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy**: `same-origin` - Prevents cross-origin attacks
- **Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy**: `same-origin` - Controls resource sharing
- **Origin-Agent-Cluster**: `?1` - Enables origin agent clustering
- **X-XSS-Protection**: `0` - Disables legacy XSS filter (recommended)

## Project Status
- ✅ **Build Status**: Project still compiles successfully
- ✅ **Test Status**: All tests passing (24 total: 9 existing + 15 new)
- ✅ **Security Scan**: MEDIUM severity Information Exposure vulnerability eliminated

## Tests Added
Added 15 comprehensive security header tests:
- X-Powered-By header elimination verification (3 tests)
- Security headers validation (9 tests)
- Legacy header handling (1 test)
- Application functionality preservation (2 tests)

## Technical Implementation
```javascript
const helmet = require('helmet');
app.use(helmet()); // Comprehensive security headers including X-Powered-By removal
```

## Human Testing Instructions
1. Visit any endpoint: `curl -I http://localhost:3000/health`
2. Expected: No `X-Powered-By` header in response
3. Expected: Multiple security headers present (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
4. Visit `/api/spotify/genres` endpoint
5. Expected: Security headers present even on error responses
6. Expected: Application functionality unchanged
