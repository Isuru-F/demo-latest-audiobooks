# Add Multi-Cast Narrator Support Toggle

## Overview
Implements a toggle filter to allow users to easily discover audiobooks with multiple narrators, following Option 2 (Separate Multi-Cast Filter Function) from the technical review in GTM-2.

## Product Manager Summary
This feature adds a "Multi-Cast Only" toggle next to the search bar that enables users to filter audiobooks to show only those with multiple narrators. The toggle provides visual feedback when active and works seamlessly with existing search functionality. Users receive appropriate feedback messages when no multi-cast audiobooks match their criteria.

## Technical Notes
- **Implementation**: Used Option 2 approach with separate `isMultiCastAudiobook()` helper function
- **Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with reusable, testable function
- **Integration**: Extends existing `filteredAudiobooks` computed property using array chaining
- **Data Handling**: Properly handles both string and object narrator types as defined in Audiobook interface
- **State Management**: Toggle state persists during search operations
- **Responsive Design**: Includes mobile-friendly layout adjustments
