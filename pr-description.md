# Add Multi-Cast Narrator Support

**Linear Issue:** [GTM-2](https://linear.app/sourcegraph/issue/GTM-2/add-multi-cast-narrator-support)

## Product Manager Summary

This PR implements a new filtering feature that allows users to filter audiobooks by narrator count. Users can now toggle "Multi-Cast Only" to view only audiobooks with multiple narrators, making it easier to find performances with diverse voice actors. The feature shows a count badge indicating how many multi-cast audiobooks are available (13 total) and works seamlessly with the existing search functionality.

## Technical Notes 

The implementation adds:
- A toggle component next to the search bar with visual active state indication
- Filtering logic that checks `audiobook.narrators.length > 1`
- State management that persists during search operations
- Combined filter functionality that works with text search
- User feedback with count badges and appropriate "no results" messages

Key changes made:
- Added `multiCastOnly` reactive state variable
- Implemented `filteredAudiobooks` computed property with multi-step filtering
- Added `multiCastCount` computed property for count display
- Created styled toggle component with purple gradient when active
- Enhanced responsive design for mobile viewports
