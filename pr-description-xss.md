# Security Fix: Prevent XSS Vulnerability in Users Controller

## Overview
Fixed a **High severity** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability found by Snyk security scan in `server/src/controllers/users.controller.js` line 44.

## Security Issue Details
The vulnerability existed because user input from `req.body` (name, bio, email) was directly interpolated into HTML template strings and sent to the browser via `res.send()` without any sanitization. This allowed attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code through the user input fields.

**Attack Vector:**
```javascript
// Malicious input could be:
bio: '<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>'
// This would execute in the browser when the profile page loaded
```

## Solution Implemented
1. **Input Sanitization**: Added `lodash.escape` library to properly escape HTML special characters (`<`, `>`, `&`, `"`, `'`) in all user inputs
2. **Content Security Policy**: Added restrictive CSP header as defense-in-depth protection
3. **Security Tests**: Created comprehensive tests to verify XSS protection works correctly

## Code Changes
- Installed `lodash.escape` dependency
- Modified `users.controller.js` to escape all user inputs before HTML rendering
- Added CSP header: `default-src 'none'; style-src 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self';`
- Created security test suite in `tests/security/xss-protection.test.js`

## Alternative Approaches Considered
- **sanitize-html**: Would allow some HTML tags but adds complexity
- **Template engine**: Better long-term solution but requires UI refactor
- **JSON response**: Most secure but changes API contract

Chose `lodash.escape` as recommended by Oracle for minimal, secure fix.

## Testing
âœ… **Project still compiles** after changes  
âœ… **All existing tests pass** (17 client tests, 9 server tests)  
âœ… **Added 2 new security tests** covering:
- XSS input escaping verification
- CSP header presence validation

### New Tests Added:
1. `should escape HTML in user input to prevent XSS` - Verifies script tags are escaped
2. `should include Content-Security-Policy header` - Confirms CSP header is present

## Verification
- âœ… Snyk scan no longer reports XSS vulnerability
- âœ… Malicious input `<script>alert("XSS")</script>` now renders as escaped text
- âœ… All functionality preserved - users can still update profiles normally

## Human Testing Instructions
1. Visit http://localhost:3000 (ensure server is running)
2. Send PUT request to `/api/users/profile` with payload:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "<script>alert('XSS')</script>", 
     "bio": "<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>",
     "email": "test@example.com"
   }
   ```
3. **Expected Result**: HTML response shows escaped characters `&lt;script&gt;` instead of executing JavaScript
4. **CSP Test**: Check response headers include `Content-Security-Policy`

## Progress Notes
âœ… Verified project builds and tests pass  
âœ… Ran Snyk security scan - found 5 vulnerabilities  
âœ… **COMPLETED: Fixed High severity XSS vulnerability**
