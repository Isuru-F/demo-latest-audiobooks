# SonarQube Issue Progress: AZhyh5QGQkXnhmx4R6NI

## Issue Summary
- **Issue Key**: AZhyh5QGQkXnhmx4R6NI
- **Rule**: css:S4666
- **Severity**: MAJOR
- **Type**: Code maintainability
- **File**: client/src/assets/base.css
- **Line**: 25 (duplicate of line 2)
- **Status**: NOT STARTED

## Problem Description
Duplicate CSS selector ":root" found at line 25, with the first occurrence at line 2. This creates ambiguity in CSS specificity and can lead to unexpected styling behavior and maintenance issues.

## Resolution Strategy
1. Analyze both :root selectors to understand their purpose
2. Merge CSS properties from both selectors into a single :root declaration
3. Remove the duplicate selector
4. Verify no styling is broken after consolidation

## Implementation Steps
- [ ] Open client/src/assets/base.css and locate both :root selectors
- [ ] Document all CSS properties in each :root block
- [ ] Identify any conflicting property declarations
- [ ] Merge properties into the first :root selector (line 2)
- [ ] Remove the duplicate :root selector at line 25
- [ ] Test application UI to ensure no visual regressions
- [ ] Run CSS linting to verify no other duplicate selectors exist

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Visual regression testing on key UI components
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility check
- [ ] CSS validation using W3C CSS Validator
- [ ] Verify CSS custom properties (variables) still work correctly
- [ ] Test both light and dark theme modes if applicable

## Status Tracking
- **Current Status**: Not Started
- **Priority**: High (MAJOR severity)
- **Estimated Time**: 30-60 minutes
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Completion Criteria**: Single :root selector, no visual regressions, CSS validation passes
