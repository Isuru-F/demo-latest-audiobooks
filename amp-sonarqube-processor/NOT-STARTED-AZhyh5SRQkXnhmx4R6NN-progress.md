# SonarQube Issue Progress: AZhyh5SRQkXnhmx4R6NN

## Issue Summary
- **Issue Key**: AZhyh5SRQkXnhmx4R6NN
- **Rule**: secrets:S6699
- **Severity**: BLOCKER
- **Type**: Security vulnerability
- **File**: server/.env
- **Line**: 3
- **Status**: NOT STARTED

## Problem Description
Spotify API key is exposed in the .env file and committed to version control. This is a critical security vulnerability as it exposes sensitive credentials that could be misused if the repository is public or compromised.

## Resolution Strategy
1. Immediately revoke the exposed Spotify API key
2. Generate new API credentials
3. Remove the secret from version control history
4. Implement proper environment variable management
5. Add .env to .gitignore to prevent future exposures

## Implementation Steps
- [ ] Log into Spotify Developer Dashboard and revoke current API key
- [ ] Generate new Spotify client ID and secret
- [ ] Remove .env file from git tracking: `git rm --cached server/.env`
- [ ] Add server/.env to .gitignore
- [ ] Create server/.env.example with placeholder values
- [ ] Update documentation for environment setup
- [ ] Purge sensitive data from git history using BFG or git-filter-branch
- [ ] Update deployment/CI configuration with new credentials
- [ ] Verify application still works with new credentials

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Verify Spotify API integration works with new credentials
- [ ] Confirm .env file is properly ignored by git
- [ ] Test local development setup with .env.example
- [ ] Validate deployment pipeline uses secure credential management

## Status Tracking
- **Current Status**: Not Started
- **Priority**: Critical (BLOCKER severity)
- **Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours
- **Dependencies**: Access to Spotify Developer Dashboard
- **Completion Criteria**: Secret revoked, new credentials working, git history cleaned
