# KAN-4: Sentry Logging Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement Sentry error tracking and performance monitoring on the client-side (Vue 3.5) of the Latest Audiobooks application.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Installation
- Install `@sentry/vue` package as a production dependency
- Package: `@sentry/vue` (official Sentry SDK for Vue 3)

### 2. Configuration Setup
- Create environment variable for Sentry DSN
- Add `.env` file support if not already present
- Configure Sentry DSN in environment variables

### 3. Sentry Initialization
- Initialize Sentry in `main.ts` before Vue app mount
- Configure the following options:
  - DSN (from environment variable)
  - Environment (development/production)
  - Traces sample rate for performance monitoring
  - Replay session sample rate for session replay
  - Vue router integration for route tracking
  - Error boundary configuration

### 4. Error Tracking Features
- Automatic error capture for:
  - Uncaught exceptions
  - Unhandled promise rejections
  - Vue component errors
  - API call failures
- Manual error reporting capability

### 5. Performance Monitoring
- Enable performance monitoring with traces
- Track:
  - Page load times
  - Navigation performance
  - API request performance
  - Component render performance

### 6. User Context
- Capture anonymous user sessions
- Track user interactions with session replay (optional)

### 7. Environment Configuration
- Development: Lower sample rates, verbose logging
- Production: Optimized sample rates, minimal logging

### 8. Testing
- Test error capture functionality
- Verify Sentry initialization
- Ensure no errors in development mode

## Technical Details

### Files to Modify
1. `client/package.json` - Add @sentry/vue dependency
2. `client/src/main.ts` - Initialize Sentry
3. `client/.env.example` - Add Sentry DSN template
4. `client/README.md` - Document Sentry setup

### Environment Variables
- `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` - Sentry Data Source Name
- `VITE_SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` - Environment name (dev/prod)

### Best Practices
- Use environment-specific sample rates
- Don't include Sentry DSN in version control
- Filter sensitive data before sending to Sentry
- Use source maps for better error tracking in production
- Set appropriate session replay sample rates

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Sentry SDK installed
- [x] Sentry initialized in main.ts
- [x] Environment variables configured
- [x] Error tracking works
- [x] Performance monitoring enabled
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] Tests pass
