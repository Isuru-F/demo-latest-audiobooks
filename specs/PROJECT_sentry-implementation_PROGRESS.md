# Sentry Implementation Project Progress

## Project Overview

**Goal**: Implement comprehensive error tracking and performance monitoring across Vue 3.5/TypeScript client and Node.js/Express server using Sentry.

**Success Metrics**:
- 95% error capture rate across client and server
- <24hr response time to critical errors  
- Performance baseline establishment for all API endpoints
- Zero sensitive data leakage
- 50% reduction in error resolution time

## Phase Status

| Phase | Status | Target Date | Dependencies | Deliverables |
|-------|--------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Phase 1: Client Foundation** | Not Started | Week 1 | Sentry account setup | Basic error capture in Vue app |
| **Phase 2: Server Integration** | Not Started | Week 2 | Phase 1 complete | Express middleware and error handling |
| **Phase 3: Advanced Features** | Not Started | Week 3 | Phase 2 complete | Performance monitoring, session replay |
| **Phase 4: Production Ready** | Not Started | Week 4 | Phase 3 complete | CI/CD integration, optimization |

## Current System State

### **Initial State (Current)**
- **Client**: Basic console.error logging in try/catch blocks
- **Server**: Simple Express error middleware with console logging
- **Error Handling**: Local error state management in Vue stores
- **Monitoring**: No centralized error tracking or performance monitoring
- **Debugging**: Manual log inspection, no session replay

### **Target State (After All Phases)**
- **Client**: Full Sentry integration with Vue 3.5, performance tracking, session replay
- **Server**: Comprehensive error capture, request context tracking, performance monitoring
- **Error Correlation**: Linked client/server errors with trace IDs
- **Monitoring**: Real-time alerts, dashboards, proactive issue identification
- **Debugging**: Source-mapped stack traces, user session replay, contextual error data

## System Evolution Through Phases

### Phase 1 Completion
- **Client State**: Sentry initialized, basic error capture replacing console.error
- **Impact**: Real-time error visibility for client-side issues
- **Risk**: Server errors still only locally logged

### Phase 2 Completion  
- **Server State**: Full Sentry middleware integration, request context tracking
- **Impact**: End-to-end error visibility across full stack
- **Capability**: Error correlation between client requests and server responses

### Phase 3 Completion
- **Advanced Features**: Performance monitoring, session replay, custom dashboards
- **Impact**: Proactive performance optimization, enhanced debugging capabilities
- **Capability**: User behavior analysis through session replay

### Phase 4 Completion
- **Production Ready**: Optimized sampling, CI/CD integration, team workflows
- **Impact**: Scalable error management, automated deployment tracking
- **Capability**: Source map management, release correlation, alerting workflows

## Risk Register

### Cross-Phase Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|-------|
| **Performance Impact** | Medium | Low | Implement sampling, monitor bundle size | Dev Team |
| **Sensitive Data Leakage** | High | Low | PII filtering, security review | Security Team |
| **Quota Overrun** | Medium | Medium | Configure sampling rates, monitor usage | DevOps |
| **Development Workflow Disruption** | Low | Medium | Gradual rollout, team training | Team Lead |

### Phase-Specific Risks

#### Phase 1 Risks
- Vue 3.5 compatibility issues with Sentry
- Bundle size increase impacting performance
- Development environment noise

#### Phase 2 Risks  
- Express middleware conflicts
- Request context overhead
- Server performance degradation

#### Phase 3 Risks
- Session replay privacy concerns
- Performance monitoring overhead
- Complex configuration management

#### Phase 4 Risks
- CI/CD integration failures
- Source map upload reliability
- Production deployment issues
